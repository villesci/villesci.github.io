Here, I present the first quantitative data on density, behavioral, habitat selection, and natural history on B. micra. I observed 117 B. micra from 10–23 April 2015. Estimated density was 3,100 individuals/ha (assuming 70% detection), and through satellite image analysis of Nosy Hara, I estimated that the population size was between 100,000–150,000 individuals. I found adult males to have a significantly larger snout-vent length (SVL) than adult females, and juvenile males to have significantly larger SVL then juvenile females. I also found no significant difference in roost height between males and females of all age classes, but I did find a positive correlation between SVL and roost height. I found individuals significantly closer to tsingy outcroppings than to trees during night and day, indicating that this is a tsingy-associated species. I support the International Union for the Conservation of Nature designation of nearthreatened due to the high population density, but threats due to tourism and small range size could pose problems for the conservation of the species.","2017","2021-04-14 19:29:20","2021-07-28 12:50:09","","334-341","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\HPDN72IS\Villeneuve - Habitat Selection and Population Density of the Wo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Which natural enemy represents the greater threat and therefore the stronger selection force on pupation site selection depends upon the time of year, the relative abundance of predators versus parasitoids, and the availability of alternative prey or hosts. Predation by foraging birds and mammals is likely to occur most commonly in winter when leaves have fallen, cocoons are conspicuous, and higher quality prey are scarcer. Inaccessibility and crypsis of pupation sites may provide protection from visually hunting predators. Attacks by parasitic wasps, which take place only during warmer months, may not be as easily avoided by inaccessibility or crypsis. We studied the patterns and mortality risks of pupation site selection in Diprion similis (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae; Introduced Pine Sawfly). Cocoons that were smaller than average and situated in relatively inaccessible sites (thinner branches, underside of branches) were less likely to be attacked by predators; background matching in terms of branch size proved not to improve survival. In contrast, the probability that a cocoon would be attacked by parasitic wasps (primarily Monodontomerus dentipes; Hymenoptera: Torymidae) was unaffected by location along branches, indicating that parasitoids are more difficult to escape through pupation site selection. Because Pine Sawflies were twice as likely to be killed by predators than by parasitoids during the cocoon stage, inaccessibility may be the most important factor for selecting pupation sites.","2017-03","2021-04-14 19:29:27","2021-04-14 19:29:27","2021-04-14 19:29:27","B19-B31","","sp7","24","","Northeastern Naturalist","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\CHG5FNY4\Wheelwright et al. - 2017 - Pupation Site Selection and Enemy Avoidance in the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neglecting potential intraspecific variation may overlook the possibility that some populations are more resilient or susceptible than others, creating inaccurate predictions of climate impacts. In addition, phenotypic plasticity can contribute to trait variation and may mediate sensitivity to climate. Quantifying such forms of intraspecific variation can improve our understanding of how climate can affect ecologically important species, such as invasive predators. Here, we quantified thermal performance (tolerance, acclimation capacity, developmental traits) across seven populations of the predatory marine snail (Urosalpinx cinerea) from native Atlantic and non-native Pacific coast populations in the USA. Using common garden experiments, we assessed the effects of source population and developmental acclimation on thermal tolerance and developmental traits of F1 snails. We then estimated climate sensitivity by calculating warming tolerance (thermal tolerance − habitat temperature), using field environmental data. We report that low-latitude populations had greater thermal tolerance than their high latitude counterparts. However, these same low-latitude populations exhibited decreased thermal tolerance when exposed to environmentally realistic higher acclimation temperatures. Low-latitude native populations had the greatest climate sensitivity (habitat temperatures near thermal limits). In contrast, invasive Pacific snails had the lowest climate sensitivity, suggesting that these populations are likely to persist and drive negative impacts on native biodiversity. Developmental rate significantly increased in embryos sourced from populations with greater habitat temperature but had variable effects on clutch size and hatching success. Thus, warming can produce widely divergent responses within the same species, resulting in enhanced impacts in the non-native range and extirpation in the native range. Broadly, our results highlight how intraspecific variation can alter management decisions, as this may clarify whether management efforts should be focused on many or only a few populations.","2021-01-01","2021-06-17 18:48:58","2021-11-04 22:12:25","2021-06-17 18:48:58","coab039","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\FJGVX9TR\Villeneuve et al. - 2021 - Diminished warming tolerance and plasticity in low.pdf","","","","Cooke, Steve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, our mechanistic understanding of how the environment shapes trait variation remains poor. Here, we used common garden experiments to quantify thermal performance in eight populations of the marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea across thermal gradients on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. We then evaluated the relationship between thermal performance and environmental metrics derived from time-series data. Our results reveal a novel pattern of ‘mixed’ trait performance adaptation, where thermal optima were positively correlated with spawning temperature (cogradient variation), while maximum trait performance was negatively correlated with season length (countergradient variation). This counterintuitive pattern probably arises because of phenological shifts in the spawning season, whereby ‘cold’ populations delay spawning until later in the year when temperatures are warmer compared to ‘warm’ populations that spawn earlier in the year when temperatures are cooler. Our results show that variation in thermal performance can be shaped by multiple facets of the environment and are linked to organismal phenology and natural history. Understanding the impacts of climate change on organisms, therefore, requires the knowledge of how climate change will alter different aspects of the thermal environment.","2021-07-28","2021-07-28 12:49:06","2021-07-28 12:49:08","2021-07-28 12:49:06","20210741","","1955","288","","","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","royalsocietypublishing-org.silk.library.umass.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\ANB8BS7C\Villeneuve et al. - 2021 - Environment and phenology shape local adaptation i.pdf","","","local adaptation; latitudinal gradients; countergradient variation; seasonality; thermal performance curve; environmental drivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plasticity in heat tolerance, which includes acclimation or hardening, occurs when prior exposure to a warmer temperature changes an organism's upper thermal limit. The capacity for thermal acclimation could provide protection against warming, but prior work has found few generalizable patterns to explain variation in this trait. Here, we report the results of, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis to examine within-species variation in thermal plasticity, using results from 20 studies (19 species) that quantified thermal acclimation capacities across 78 populations. We used meta-regression to evaluate two leading hypotheses. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that populations from more thermally variable habitats will have greater plasticity, while the trade-off hypothesis predicts that populations with the lowest heat tolerance will have the greatest plasticity. Our analysis indicates strong support for the trade-off hypothesis because populations with greater thermal tolerance had reduced plasticity. These results advance our understanding of variation in populations' susceptibility to climate change and imply that populations with the highest thermal tolerance may have limited phenotypic plasticity to adjust to ongoing climate warming.","2021-09-08","2021-09-14 15:59:21","2021-09-14 15:59:22","2021-09-14 15:59:21","20210765","","1958","288","","Proc.

We found strong differentiation in heat tolerance across populations in marine and intertidal taxa but not terrestrial or freshwater taxa. This is counter to the expectation that increased connectivity in the ocean should reduce intraspecific variation. Such adaptive differentiation in the ocean suggests there may be standing genetic variation at the species level to buffer climate impacts.

When thermal stress exceeds organismal capacity to maintain homeostasis, organism survival becomes time‐limited and can result in mass mortality events.                                                     Current methods of detecting and categorizing MHWs rely on statistical analysis of historic climatology and do not consider biological effects as a basis of MHW severity. The re‐emergence of ectotherm thermal tolerance landscape models provides a physiological framework for assessing the lethal effects of MHWs by accounting for both the magnitude and duration of extreme heat events.                                                     Here, we used a simulation approach to understand the effects of a suite of MHW profiles on organism survival probability across (1) three thermal tolerance adaptive strategies, (2) interannual temperature variation and (3) seasonal timing of MHWs.                                                     We identified survival isoclines across MHW magnitude and duration where acute (short duration‐high magnitude) and chronic (long duration‐low magnitude) events had equivalent lethal effects on marine organisms. While most research attention has focused on chronic MHW events, we show similar lethal effects can be experienced by more common but neglected acute marine heat spikes. Critically, a statistical definition of MHWs does not accurately categorize biological mortality.                                                     By letting organism responses define the extremeness of a MHW event, we can build a mechanistic understanding of MHW effects from a physiological basis. Organism responses can then be transferred across scales of ecological organization and better predict marine ecosystem shifts to MHWs.","2024-06-08","2024-06-11 12:33:31","2024-06-11 12:33:31","2024-06-11 12:33:31","1365-2656.14120","","","","","Journal of Animal Ecology","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\GVSAEI7V\Villeneuve_White_2024_Predicting organismal response to marine heatwaves using dynamic thermal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Atlantic oyster drill (Urosalpinx cinerea) is a marine snail whose native range spans the strongest coastal latitudinal temperature gradient in the world, with invasive populations established on the US Pacific coast. Here, we leverage this system using genome-wide SNPs and environmental data to examine invasion history and identify genotype–environment associations indicative of local adaptation across the native range, and then assess evidence for allelic frequency shifts that would signal rapid adaptation within invasive populations. We demonstrate strong genetic structuring among native regions which aligns with life history expectations, identifying southern New England as the source of invasive populations. Then, we identify putatively thermally adaptive loci across the native range but find no evidence of allele frequency shifts in invasive populations that suggest rapid adaptation to new environments. Our results indicate that while these loci may underpin local thermal adaptation in their native range, selection is relaxed in invasive populations, perhaps due to complex polygenic architecture underlying thermal traits and/or standing capacity for phenotypic plasticity. Given the prolific invasion of Urosalpinx, our study suggests population success in new environments is influenced by factors other than selection on standing genetic variation that underlies local adaptation in the native range and highlights the importance of considering population history and environmental selection pressures when evaluating adaptive capacity.","","2024-11-11 17:46:33","2024-11-11 17:46:33","2024-11-11 17:46:33","e17575","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.17575","","C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\QNJ73BC7\Bentley et al_Successful Invasion Into New Environments Without Evidence of Rapid Adaptation.pdf; C:\Users\drewv\Zotero\storage\YXLUPMCI\mec.html","","","climate change; local adaptation; invasive species; seascape genomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

    "text": "I am thrilled to post that the first publication out of my PhD was recently published in Journal of Animal Ecology (Villeneuve and White (2024))! I authored a blog post on the journal’s blog, so I won’t repeat myself too much here. Rather, I want to go over why we did this study in the first place, and my top takeaways.\nThe kernel of an idea for this paper really took off when Easton and I were in Madagascar, and in between field work with our collaborators we talked a lot about extreme events and how to measure them, heatwaves in particular. Excellent work by Hobday et al. (2018) used statistical analysis of timeseries to understand when a heat event was anomalously extreme, and thus a heatwave. While such an approach allows one to account for variation in the temporal (duration) and thermal (intensity/magnitude) dimensions, the issue remained that comparing events with multiple measurement dimensions is difficult. Among the questions we asked was: what is worse, a long but mild heatwave, or a short but intense one? And, what if we could classify extreme events based on their ecological effects, rather than their statistical novelty?\nThere are a few different ways we could have gone around this. We could have taken an empirical approach, wherein I either observe organism responses in the field to different types of heatwave (data availability issues, not easily comparable between events) or I simulate heatwaves in the lab and observe responses (more controlled, but I could only replicate a dozen or so realistic heatwaves). We decided that, given the wide-open nature of the question to conduct an in silica simulation to generate a continuous response surface across many (527!) heatwaves varying in magnitude and duration. As our response, we selected survival resulting from thermal death time models (Rezende et al. (2020), Jørgensen et al. (2021)).\nNow, I will be the first to stop here and point out that heatwaves do not just affect survival. Temperature is a master factor, and can affect reproduction, morphology, development rate, metabolism, growth, and behavior, all of which we could have used as our response. I chose survival because 1) we have models of thermal tolerance that lend themselves really well to continuous time series that are just begging to be tested more extensively, and 2) frankly, other than species movement, death has a ton of public, conservation, and management visibility and is the ultimate ecological repercussion. When the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatdome hit Puget Sound, billions of intertidal organisms died on the shorelines. That is going to leave an indelible effect on the population dynamics of these species in the area. I also see mass mortality events from events like heatwaves as the first step in the march to local extirpation, and then global extinction. That may be a dramatic reading, especially since mobile animals can just move out of the way. But for sessile organisms (I’m thinking of you, corals and bivalves), there is no escape.\nAt this point, I am going to actually gloss over the results of our study (you can read the article or JAE blog entry to get those minutiae) and just deliver my big takeaways:\nSo, what’s next? This was obviously a simulation experiment, so someone needs to test some of our conclusions with empirical data! I will work on some aspects myself, but I feel this work stood on the shoulders of some really impressive and creative science (@ all teams I cite here) and can only presume more exciting work is waiting in the wings."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nOne thing I wish I cautioned more in my paper was that acute and chronic tolerance may not be an inherent tradeoff (see Rezende, Castañeda, and Santos (2014), Castañeda, Rezende, and Santos (2015) , Jørgensen, Malte, and Overgaard (2019), Kovacevic, Latombe, and Chown (2019) for the full debate). I am not picking sides at this point, other than saying there’s room for research from a more adaptive underpinnings angle in non-model species. The fact remains that variation in acute and chronic tolerance exists, and we don’t have any good explanations as to why that is so.↩︎"

    "text": "News Center Maine recently spoke with myself and my PI Easton White about our ongoing work building modeling tools to understand the impacts of extreme thermal events (heatwaves, coldwaves) on oyster populations in New Hampshire. The video attracted my first climate change denialist troll in the comments, which I feel may be a right of passage.\n\n\n\nDespite what some youtube comments would let you believe, the world’s oceans like the Gulf of Maine are rapidly warming due to the exponential release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from human activity."

I use these models to forecast individual and population-level responses to heatwave events. Why predict over heatwaves?\nHeatwaves, rather than gradual warming about the meteorological mean, are the driving abiotic factor behind marine invertebrate physiological stress. Because they highly variable in duration, magnitude and return time, it is difficult to predict organismal responses using traditional physiological exposure experiments.\nI use experiments to parameterize these thermal death time models, but primarily am using a simulation approach to understand how heatwaves of varying magnitude, duration, and return time affect organismal survivorship and metapopulation dynamics. I currently focus on the eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica.\n\n\n\n\nMarine Local Adaptation - Master’s Research\nAs ecologists attempting to understand the impacts of climate change on marine organisms, we often neglect to consider how evolution may play a role in making organisms either more or less susceptible to climate change impacts. Organisms often have a plastic ability to change their physiology or behavior when subjected to different environmental conditions, but environmental changes that last for longer periods of time may drive evolutionary events, manifesting as a shift in genotypes. Countergradient variation is a type of local adaptation where organisms in cooler environments show comparatively higher growth rates than populations in warmer environments . This may result because of shorter growing seasons at high latitudes, where organisms must exploit small windows of ideal growing conditions. Therefore, if an evolutionary event were to drive a cool genotype organism to a warm genotype as a result of climate change, we can expect to see an overall decrease in organismal growth rates. This is an implication that is not fully appreciated in the field. \n\nThrough my Master’s research, I sought to better understand how populations of a single species may react differently to climate change. A common assumption of ecological niche models is trait homogeneity across a species, while in fact populations may inhabit diverse environments and be locally adapted to those conditions. The implication of this locally adapted reality is that some populations will be more resilient to climate change than others. I used the predatory marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea to ask these questions about intraspecific variation, specifically quantifying thermal tolerance and growth rates. This snail species is native to the Atlantic coast of the US and is an invasive species on the Pacific coast. In addition, it is a common marine predator on wild and cultured Eastern (Crassostrea virginica) and Pacific (C. gigas) oysters. My results will therefore not only inform coastal managers of projected U. cinerea sensitivity to climate change, but contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding how we predict organisms will react to climate change. ​\n\nThis research was recently published in Conservation Physiology (thermal tolerance and plasticity) and Proceedings of the Royal Society: B (growth rates, environmental drivers of adaptation). Research was supported by the American Malacological Society and the PADI Foundation.\nThis research provided pilot data for a successful NSF-funded grant by my Master’s advisor, Brian Cheng. Research continues at UMass with Project Uro!\n \n\n\nTropical Aquatic Ecology\n\n\n\nTagged Nerite snails to track migration rate\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017 I served as the Aquatic Ecologist for Operation Wallacea at their Dominica field site. In addition to working with high school students performing macroinvertebrate surveys, I developed a research program tracking the migration rates of a species of amphidromous freshwater snail, Nereina punctulata, across altitude and river flow rate. These hyper-abundant snails are likely extremely important for the transport of nutrients into oligotrophic headwaters of tropical streams. We found snails increase their migration rate low in the watershed, likely to avoid being swept downstream by freshets and to avoid large predators. Further, large snails were found more often in upstream areas, but smaller snails tended to exploit high flow environments once they had reached a few kilometers upstream. Antillean streams provide a unique opportunity to ask further questions on energy acquisition and predator avoidance. Research on Nereina migration is published in Aquatic Ecology.\n\n\nChameleon habitat use\n\n\n\nThe world’s second smallest lizard, Brookesia micra\n\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I performed research on the remote island of Nosy Hara, Madagascar, quantifying population density and habitat use of the cryptic leaf chameleon Brookesia micra. I was able to demonstrate novel habitat use by this primarily leaf-litter dwelling genus by showing the presence of this species on limestone outcroppings. Further, I performed the first intensive survey of the island for the species. Findings delivered to MNP, Nosy Hara National Park.

I specifically seek to combine empirical data of organismal physiology and distribution, environmental and extreme event data, and fisheries data into models of population dynamics under climate change.\nI am currently a Marine Biology PhD candidate at the University of New Hampshire in the Department of Biological Sciences, advised by Dr. Easton White in the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL).\nAndrew earned his bachelor’s in Biology from Bowdoin College in 2016 and his master’s in Environmental Conservation from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021. At UMass Amherst, he worked in the  Marine Global Change Ecology Lab  lab with Dr. Brian Cheng understanding the role of local adaptation in driving intraspecific trait variation and climate sensitivity of the marine predatory gastropod Urosalpinx cinerea. He was a 2021 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow with NOAA Fisheries, where he supported efforts to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge from Inuit groups into an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, and developed communication materials about NOAA Fisheries surveys for the public and Congress.\n\nI have performed field work in Maine, California, New Brunswick, Mexico, Curacao, The Bahamas, and Madagascar working on a diverse set of systems and questions. I’ve performed common garden lab experiments, counted leaf chameleons, tracked freshwater snail migrations, worked on the genetics of invasive tunicates, mapped wilderness areas in the California Sierra Nevada, and grown farmed scallops.\n\n When not working on his research, Andrew likes to spend his time outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, diving, getting lost, and taking nature walks."

    "text": "BioCV\n\n\nI am a global change marine ecologist interested in working with data across scales of biological organization to better understand the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and the people that depend on them. I specifically seek to combine empirical data of organismal physiology and distribution, environmental and extreme event data, and fisheries data into models of population dynamics under climate change.\nI am currently a Marine Biology PhD student at the University of New Hampshire in the Department of Biological Sciences, advised by Dr. Easton White in the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL).\nAndrew earned his bachelor’s in Biology from Bowdoin College in 2016 and his master’s in Environmental Conservation from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021. At UMass Amherst, he worked in the  Marine Global Change Ecology Lab  lab with Dr. Brian Cheng understanding the role of local adaptation in driving intraspecific trait variation and climate sensitivity of the marine predatory gastropod Urosalpinx cinerea. He was a 2021 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow with NOAA Fisheries, where he supported efforts to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge from Inuit groups into an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, and developed communication materials about NOAA Fisheries surveys for the public and Congress.\n\nI have performed field work in Maine, California, New Brunswick, Mexico, Curacao, The Bahamas, and Madagascar working on a diverse set of systems and questions. I’ve performed common garden lab experiments, counted leaf chameleons, tracked freshwater snail migrations, worked on the genetics of invasive tunicates, mapped wilderness areas in the California Sierra Nevada, and grown farmed scallops.\n\n When not working on his research, Andrew likes to spend his time outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, diving, getting lost, and taking nature walks."

I use these models to forecast indiviudal and population-level responses to heatwave events. Why predict over heatwaves?\nHeatwaves, rather than gradual warming about the meteorological mean, are the driving abiotic factor behind marine invertebrate physiological stress. Because they highly variable in duration, magnitude and return time, it is difficult to predict organismal responses using traditional physiological exposure experiments.\nI use experiments to parameterize these thermal death time models, but primarily am using a simulation approach to understand how heatwaves of varying magnitude, duration, and return time affect organismal survivorship and metapopulation dynamics. I currently focus on the eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica.\n\n\n\n\nMarine Local Adaptation - Master’s Research\nAs ecologists attempting to understand the impacts of climate change on marine organisms, we often neglect to consider how evolution may play a role in making organisms either more or less susceptible to climate change impacts. Organisms often have a plastic ability to change their physiology or behavior when subjected to different environmental conditions, but environmental changes that last for longer periods of time may drive evolutionary events, manifesting as a shift in genotypes. Countergradient variation is a type of local adaptation where organisms in cooler environments show comparatively higher growth rates than populations in warmer environments . This may result because of shorter growing seasons at high latitudes, where organisms must exploit small windows of ideal growing conditions. Therefore, if an evolutionary event were to drive a cool genotype organism to a warm genotype as a result of climate change, we can expect to see an overall decrease in organismal growth rates. This is an implication that is not fully appreciated in the field. \n\nThrough my Master’s research, I sought to better understand how populations of a single species may react differently to climate change. A common assumption of ecological niche models is trait homogeneity across a species, while in fact populations may inhabit diverse environments and be locally adapted to those conditions. The implication of this locally adapted reality is that some populations will be more resilient to climate change than others. I used the predatory marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea to ask these questions about intraspecific variation, specifically quantifying thermal tolerance and growth rates. This snail species is native to the Atlantic coast of the US and is an invasive species on the Pacific coast. In addition, it is a common marine predator on wild and cultured Eastern (Crassostrea virginica) and Pacific (C. gigas) oysters. My results will therefore not only inform coastal managers of projected U. cinerea sensitivity to climate change, but contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding how we predict organisms will react to climate change. ​\n\nThis research was recently published in Conservation Physiology (thermal tolerance and plasticity) and Proceedings of the Royal Society: B (growth rates, environmental drivers of adaptation). Research was supported by the American Malacological Society and the PADI Foundation.\nThis research provided pilot data for a successful NSF-funded grant by my Master’s advisor, Brian Cheng. Research continues at UMass with Project Uro!\n \n\n\nTropical Aquatic Ecology\n\n\n\nTagged Nerite snails to track migration rate\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017 I served as the Aquatic Ecologist for Operation Wallacea at their Dominica field site. In addition to working with high school students performing macroinvertebrate surveys, I developed a research program tracking the migration rates of a species of amphidromous freshwater snail, Nereina punctulata, across altitude and river flow rate. These hyper-abundant snails are likely extremely important for the transport of nutrients into oligotrophic headwaters of tropical streams. We found snails increase their migration rate low in the watershed, likely to avoid being swept downstream by freshets and to avoid large predators. Further, large snails were found more often in upstream areas, but smaller snails tended to exploit high flow environments once they had reached a few kilometers upstream. Antillean streams provide a unique opportunity to ask further questions on energy acquisition and predator avoidance. Research on Nereina migration is published in Aquatic Ecology.\n\n\nChameleon habitat use\n\n\n\nThe world’s second smallest lizard, Brookesia micra\n\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I performed research on the remote island of Nosy Hara, Madagascar, quantifying population density and habitat use of the cryptic leaf chameleon Brookesia micra. I was able to demonstrate novel habitat use by this primarily leaf-litter dwelling genus by showing the presence of this species on limestone outcroppings.

The function I am sharing today had it’s origins in my master’s research, when I needed to obtain LT50 measures from snails in a heatbar experiment. The heatbar (Fig. 1) created a ramp of temperatures using a heating element on one end and a cooling element (ice water bath) on the other. The block itself was made of aluminium, and had three rows of holes drilled into the bar to accommodate generic falcon tubes. During the experiment, I had snails distributed in tubes along this gradient and heated one end of the bar to 60C for five hours. Every hour, I measured the temperature in every column position along the heatbar with a thermocouple. At the end of the five hours, I recorded final temperature and the alive/dead state of each snail in each position. This gave me data that had temperature and a binomial alive/dead state. A great exercise in binomial regression.\n\n\n\nHeatbar system for obtaining LT50. UMass Amherst Gloucester Marine Station"

This is particularly useful in the context of scraping thermal limit data from older papers that maybe do not report or calculate LT50 from survivorship data at given temperatures.\n\n#A function to obtain LT50 values from survivorship curves across multiple temperature exposures\n#columns in dataframe should contain a temp, survival, and exposure (in minutes) column\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(brglm)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nlt50fun<-function(data){\n  exun<-unique(data$exposure)\n  df<-list()\n  for (i in 1:length(exun)){\n    tmp<-filter(data,exposure==exun[[i]])\n    df[[i]]<-tmp\n    \n  }\n  \n  modlist<-list()\n  for (i in 1:length(df)){\n    mod<-brglm(data=df[[i]],survival~temp,family=\"binomial\")\n    modlist[[i]]<-mod\n  }\n  names(modlist)<-exun\n  \n  LT50<-list()\n  for(i in 1:length(modlist)){\n    lt<-dose.p(modlist[[i]],p=0.5)[1]\n    LT50[[i]]<-lt[[1]]\n  }\n  \n  lt50df<-data.frame(as.data.frame(LT50)%>%tidyr::gather(exposure,temp)%>%mutate(exposure=exun)%>%mutate(\"survival\"=0.5))%>%mutate(\"type\"=\"LT50\")\n  \n  data<-(rbind(data%>%mutate(\"type\"=\"obs\"),lt50df))\n  \n  fit<-brglm(survival~temp*exposure,data=data,family=\"binomial\")\n  pred_fit<-data.frame(temp=seq(min(data$temp),max(data$temp),\n                                len=500),exposure=rep(unique(data$exposure),each=500))\n  pred_fit$survival<-predict(fit, pred_fit,type=\"response\")\n  \n  \n  x<-ggplot()+geom_point(data=data,aes(x=temp,y=survival,group=exposure))+geom_line(data=pred_fit,aes(x=temp,y=survival))+\n    facet_wrap(~exposure)+geom_point(data=data%>%filter(type==\"LT50\"),aes(x=temp,y=survival,group=exposure),color=\"red\")+\n    geom_hline(yintercept=0.5,linetype=\"dashed\")+geom_text(data=data%>%filter(type==\"LT50\"),aes(x=temp,y=survival,label=sprintf(fmt=\"%0.2f\",round(temp,digits=2))),nudge_y=0.03,nudge_x=-2)\n  \n  \n  par(ask=TRUE)\n  print(x)\n  return(lt50df)\n}\n\nThis function requires three columns in your dataframe, renamed as follows:\n\ntemp: temperature of treatment in degrees Celsius\nsurvival: pooled survivorship percentage for each temperature treatment\nexposure: can be any grouping of interest; I built the function considering different lengths of exposure in minutes\n\nLet’s try this function out on some raw data. I stumbled across a very cool paper comparing the effects of different aerial exposure durations on LT50 in the mangrove oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae (Littlewood (1989) ). The authors wanted to know if duration of emersion during low tide would impact thermal tolerance of mangrove oysters. Figure 3 displays percent survival of oyster groups exposed to three different emersion levels. I extracted data.\n\n\n\nFig. 2 Survival data of C. rhizophorae over emersion treatments. Data from Littlewood (1989) .\n\n\nI extracted survival using Webplot Digitzier (an amazing tool for anyone conducting metanalysis). Once I have a spreadsheet of survival, I can quickly read it into R and extract LT50 measures, and produce plots of survival curves.\n\nlittlewood_rhizo<-read.csv(\"rhizo_surv.csv\")\n#conver to percentage scale\nlittlewood_rhizo$survival<-littlewood_rhizo$survival/100\n\nrhizolt<-lt50fun(littlewood_rhizo)\n\n\n\n\nCalculated LT50 values are also produced from this function.\n\n\n  exposure     temp survival type\n1     1440 37.61013      0.5 LT50\n2      400 43.54473      0.5 LT50\n3      120 48.38119      0.5 LT50\n\n\nThese LT50 measures are pretty close to what Littlewood (1989) calculated!\nWhile I would argue that LT50 is not a very useful measure of thermal tolerance (a future blog topic), this allows us to see that aerial exposure duration seems to cause a large decrease in LT50!\nLet me know if you have any improvements or comments.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLittlewood, D.

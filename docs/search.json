I specifically seek to combine empirical data of organismal physiology and distribution, environmental and extreme event data, and fisheries data into models of population dynamics under climate change.\nI am currently a Marine Biology PhD candidate at the University of New Hampshire in the Department of Biological Sciences, advised by Dr. Easton White in the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL).\nAndrew earned his bachelor’s in Biology from Bowdoin College in 2016 and his master’s in Environmental Conservation from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021. At UMass Amherst, he worked in the  Marine Global Change Ecology Lab  lab with Dr. Brian Cheng understanding the role of local adaptation in driving intraspecific trait variation and climate sensitivity of the marine predatory gastropod Urosalpinx cinerea. He was a 2021 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow with NOAA Fisheries, where he supported efforts to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge from Inuit groups into an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, and developed communication materials about NOAA Fisheries surveys for the public and Congress.\n\nI have performed field work in Maine, California, New Brunswick, Mexico, Curacao, The Bahamas, and Madagascar working on a diverse set of systems and questions. I’ve performed common garden lab experiments, counted leaf chameleons, tracked freshwater snail migrations, worked on the genetics of invasive tunicates, mapped wilderness areas in the California Sierra Nevada, and grown farmed scallops.\n\n When not working on his research, Andrew likes to spend his time outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, diving, getting lost, and taking nature walks."

I use these models to forecast individual and population-level responses to heatwave events. Why predict over heatwaves?\nHeatwaves, rather than gradual warming about the meteorological mean, are the driving abiotic factor behind marine invertebrate physiological stress. Because they highly variable in duration, magnitude and return time, it is difficult to predict organismal responses using traditional physiological exposure experiments.\nI use experiments to parameterize these thermal death time models, but primarily am using a simulation approach to understand how heatwaves of varying magnitude, duration, and return time affect organismal survivorship and metapopulation dynamics. I currently focus on the eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica.\n\n\n\n\nMarine Local Adaptation - Master’s Research\nAs ecologists attempting to understand the impacts of climate change on marine organisms, we often neglect to consider how evolution may play a role in making organisms either more or less susceptible to climate change impacts. Organisms often have a plastic ability to change their physiology or behavior when subjected to different environmental conditions, but environmental changes that last for longer periods of time may drive evolutionary events, manifesting as a shift in genotypes. Countergradient variation is a type of local adaptation where organisms in cooler environments show comparatively higher growth rates than populations in warmer environments . This may result because of shorter growing seasons at high latitudes, where organisms must exploit small windows of ideal growing conditions. Therefore, if an evolutionary event were to drive a cool genotype organism to a warm genotype as a result of climate change, we can expect to see an overall decrease in organismal growth rates. This is an implication that is not fully appreciated in the field. \n\nThrough my Master’s research, I sought to better understand how populations of a single species may react differently to climate change. A common assumption of ecological niche models is trait homogeneity across a species, while in fact populations may inhabit diverse environments and be locally adapted to those conditions. The implication of this locally adapted reality is that some populations will be more resilient to climate change than others. I used the predatory marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea to ask these questions about intraspecific variation, specifically quantifying thermal tolerance and growth rates. This snail species is native to the Atlantic coast of the US and is an invasive species on the Pacific coast. In addition, it is a common marine predator on wild and cultured Eastern (Crassostrea virginica) and Pacific (C. gigas) oysters. My results will therefore not only inform coastal managers of projected U. cinerea sensitivity to climate change, but contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding how we predict organisms will react to climate change. ​\n\nThis research was recently published in Conservation Physiology (thermal tolerance and plasticity) and Proceedings of the Royal Society: B (growth rates, environmental drivers of adaptation). Research was supported by the American Malacological Society and the PADI Foundation.\nThis research provided pilot data for a successful NSF-funded grant by my Master’s advisor, Brian Cheng.

In addition to working with high school students performing macroinvertebrate surveys, I developed a research program tracking the migration rates of a species of amphidromous freshwater snail, Nereina punctulata, across altitude and river flow rate. These hyper-abundant snails are likely extremely important for the transport of nutrients into oligotrophic headwaters of tropical streams. We found snails increase their migration rate low in the watershed, likely to avoid being swept downstream by freshets and to avoid large predators. Further, large snails were found more often in upstream areas, but smaller snails tended to exploit high flow environments once they had reached a few kilometers upstream. Antillean streams provide a unique opportunity to ask further questions on energy acquisition and predator avoidance.

The heatbar (Fig. 1) created a ramp of temperatures using a heating element on one end and a cooling element (ice water bath) on the other. The block itself was made of aluminium, and had three rows of holes drilled into the bar to accommodate generic falcon tubes. During the experiment, I had snails distributed in tubes along this gradient and heated one end of the bar to 60C for five hours. Every hour, I measured the temperature in every column position along the heatbar with a thermocouple. At the end of the five hours, I recorded final temperature and the alive/dead state of each snail in each position. This gave me data that had temperature and a binomial alive/dead state.

I stumbled across a very cool paper comparing the effects of different aerial exposure durations on LT50 in the mangrove oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae (Littlewood (1989) ). The authors wanted to know if duration of emersion during low tide would impact thermal tolerance of mangrove oysters.

    "text": "In July 2023, QMEL PI Dr. Easton White and I joined our collaborator Dr. Mez Baker-Médard (ONJA lab, Middlebury College) in Madagascar to take part in field surveys related to our joint lab NSF project. The overarching goal of this grant is to understand how different social and gender dynamics within fishing villages affect the social adhesion, efficacy, and diversity of marine protected areas (MPAs). This work is driven by Dr. Baker-Médard’s incredible team of Malagasy students and field technicians who have been collecting social and ecological data in the island’s south for years. In 2023, the goal shifted from the long, linear barrier-reef system of the dry southern coast to the rocky fringing reef systems of the wet north.\n\n\n\nPirogues on Nosy Sakatia\n\n\nWe spent the first two weeks on the island of Nosy Be, where we met the Malagasy team and established a set of survey sites outside and within protected areas. These protected areas ranged from highly managed tourist sites, to areas restricted by fady, or social taboo, rather than centralized governance or NGOs. Protected and unprotected reefs were paired with a fishing village in which our research technicians would conduct social surveys across social and gender strata. I mainly joined the ecology team, where we deployed Baited Remote Underwater System (BRUV) cameras to collect mobile fish diversity data and conducted intertidal reef surveys. I got to observe a lot of different reefs on Nosy Be, ranging from beautiful Acropora reefs with healthy inshore seagrass to badly damaged boulder reefs with little structural diversity.\n\n\n\nPutting the ‘quantitative’ into empirical ecology\n\n\nAs an ecologist who thinks a lot about temperature, I was more keen to observe some fascinating intertidal oyster reefs that formed on boulders along shore. On these black rocks, exposed to the tropical sun, grew rock oysters (Saccostrea sp.) with wide bases and limited vertical protuberance above the rock itself. These oysters must reach scorching temperatures during the austral summer at low tide - is their body temperature much lower than the rock itself? How close to their thermal limits do these oysters live? Many fascinating thermal ecology questions to consider!\n\n\n\nSaccostrea - for invertebrate connoisseurs only\n\n\nFor the next leg of my trip, I was to deploy temperature loggers aross a depth gradient on the barrier reef system in the south for my thermal landscape project. We believe heatwaves will be more acutely felt in shallow, reef flat environments that are uncovered at the lowest monthly tides. People who fish on these flats will therefore experience the effects of heat stressed fish and invertebrate populations sooner than those fishing on deep reefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset in Salary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome time may have been spent on the beach\n\n\n\n\n\nI flew from Nosy Be to Toliara, the great city of southwest Madagascar. From Toliara, I took a four hour 4x4 ride to the coastal village of Salary. Salary is one of the main southern research sites of the grant, and so was a natural location for logger deployment. I was able to deploy nine temperature loggers spanning the four major biophysical reef zones - flat, lagoon, reef crest, and reef slope. For this deployment, I chose ElectricBlue’s sleek encapsulated loggers that minimize the chance of battery compartment flooding and maximize data points. Once a suitable location was found, I zip-tied loggers directly into the reef matrix and took videos and GPS waypoints of their placement to aid in retrieval years from now. Nonetheless, it will be a challenge to retrieve these loggers: fishers, cyclones, and wave action can potentially remove the loggers from their locations. This is one of the challenges of deploying instruments in remote locations, where routine monitoring and purpose-built anchor systems are not possible.\n\n\n\nTemperature logger placement on a high wave-action forereef slope\n\n\nComing back to Madagascar was an incredible privilege, and I hope to work with in-country researchers to guide this research forward. Some of my more ambitious research ideas will likely not be logistically possible alone, and the ethics of flying back and forth once a year for data collection are questionable when so many capable scientists are in-country already. Nonetheless, I hope to be able to make it back at least one more time to keep the thermal landscape project moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNga was the best driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFred was the best boat captain"

    "text": "I am thrilled to post that the first publication out of my PhD was recently published in Journal of Animal Ecology (Villeneuve and White (2024))! I authored a blog post on the journal’s blog, so I won’t repeat myself too much here. Rather, I want to go over why we did this study in the first place, and my top takeaways.\nThe kernel of an idea for this paper really took off when Easton and I were in Madagascar, and in between field work with our collaborators we talked a lot about extreme events and how to measure them, heatwaves in particular. Excellent work by Hobday et al. (2018) used statistical analysis of timeseries to understand when a heat event was anomalously extreme, and thus a heatwave. While such an approach allows one to account for variation in the temporal (duration) and thermal (intensity/magnitude) dimensions, the issue remained that comparing events with multiple measurement dimensions is difficult. Among the questions we asked was: what is worse, a long but mild heatwave, or a short but intense one? And, what if we could classify extreme events based on their ecological effects, rather than their statistical novelty?\nThere are a few different ways we could have gone around this. We could have taken an empirical approach, wherein I either observe organism responses in the field to different types of heatwave (data availability issues, not easily comparable between events) or I simulate heatwaves in the lab and observe responses (more controlled, but I could only replicate a dozen or so realistic heatwaves). We decided that, given the wide-open nature of the question to conduct an in silica simulation to generate a continuous response surface across many (527!) heatwaves varying in magnitude and duration. As our response, we selected survival resulting from thermal death time models (Rezende et al. (2020), Jørgensen et al. (2021)).\nNow, I will be the first to stop here and point out that heatwaves do not just affect survival. Temperature is a master factor, and can affect reproduction, morphology, development rate, metabolism, growth, and behavior, all of which we could have used as our response. I chose survival because 1) we have models of thermal tolerance that lend themselves really well to continuous time series that are just begging to be tested more extensively, and 2) frankly, other than species movement, death has a ton of public, conservation, and management visibility and is the ultimate ecological repercussion. When the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatdome hit Puget Sound, billions of intertidal organisms died on the shorelines. That is going to leave an indelible effect on the population dynamics of these species in the area. I also see mass mortality events from events like heatwaves as the first step in the march to local extirpation, and then global extinction. That may be a dramatic reading, especially since mobile animals can just move out of the way. But for sessile organisms (I’m thinking of you, corals and bivalves), there is no escape.\nAt this point, I am going to actually gloss over the results of our study (you can read the article or JAE blog entry to get those minutiae) and just deliver my big takeaways:\nSo, what’s next? This was obviously a simulation experiment, so someone needs to test some of our conclusions with empirical data! I will work on some aspects myself, but I feel this work stood on the shoulders of some really impressive and creative science (@ all teams I cite here) and can only presume more exciting work is waiting in the wings."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nOne thing I wish I cautioned more in my paper was that acute and chronic tolerance may not be an inherent tradeoff (see Rezende, Castañeda, and Santos (2014), Castañeda, Rezende, and Santos (2015) , Jørgensen, Malte, and Overgaard (2019), Kovacevic, Latombe, and Chown (2019) for the full debate). I am not picking sides at this point, other than saying there’s room for research from a more adaptive underpinnings angle in non-model species. The fact remains that variation in acute and chronic tolerance exists, and we don’t have any good explanations as to why that is so.↩︎"

News Center Maine recently spoke with myself and my PI Easton White about our ongoing work building modeling tools to understand the impacts of extreme thermal events (heatwaves, coldwaves) on oyster populations in New Hampshire. The video attracted my first climate change denialist troll in the comments, which I feel may be a right of passage.

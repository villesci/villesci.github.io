## Bio

**I am a global change marine ecologist interested in working with data across scales of biological organization to better understand the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and the people that depend on them. I specifically seek to combine empirical data of organismal physiology and distribution, environmental and extreme event data, and fisheries data into models of population dynamics under climate change.**

**I am currently a Marine Biology PhD student at the University of New Hampshire in the Department of Biological Sciences, advised by Dr. Easton White in the [Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL)](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/).**

Andrew earned his bachelor's in Biology from Bowdoin College in 2016 and his master's in Environmental Conservation from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021. At UMass Amherst, he worked in the  [Marine Global Change Ecology Lab ](https://bscheng.com/) lab with Dr. Brian Cheng understanding the role of local adaptation in driving intraspecific trait variation and climate sensitivity of the marine predatory gastropod *Urosalpinx cinerea*. He was a 2021 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow with NOAA Fisheries, where he supported efforts to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge from Inuit groups into an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, and developed communication materials about NOAA Fisheries surveys for the public and Congress.

**\
**I have performed field work in Maine, California, New Brunswick, Mexico, Curacao, The Bahamas, and Madagascar working on a diverse set of systems and questions. I've performed common garden lab experiments, counted leaf chameleons, tracked freshwater snail migrations, worked on the genetics of invasive tunicates, mapped wilderness areas in the California Sierra Nevada, and grown farmed scallops.**\
\
** When not working on his research, Andrew likes to spend his time outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, diving, getting lost, and [taking nature walks](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1160923).
